<br />
This is a little mod to help JEI search by pinyin in a Chinese environment. 

The developer uses simplified Chinese
but it should also work for traditional Chinese (not tested).

With this mod, you can search by full pinyin, 
consonant or any combination of both (全拼，声母或两者的任意组合).

- This mod is a coremod that changes only one line of the bytecode of JEI.
- This mod relies on library "pinyin4j" to work,
which is not given in this repository. 
There is a simplified version of "pinyin4j" in the released files.

Have fun!
